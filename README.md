# guessingGame
This is a basic guessing game to guess a number between 0 and 50. Some basic styling using CSS.
JavaScript is the main focus here using math.floor and math.random to generate a random number.

Ideally the code would have external CSS and JS files, but for the purposes of demonstrating the game, they are in a single file.
